Fluoroscopy supervision of the cervical spine. ANESTHESIA  Local. INDICATIONS This patient suffers from moderate to severe pain due to cervical spine disease. The patient s history and physical exam were reviewed. The risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure were discussed, and all questions were answered to the patient s satisfaction. The patient agreed to proceed, and written informed consent was obtained. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL The patient was brought into the procedure room and placed in the prone position on the fluoroscopy table. Standard monitors were placed, and vital signs were observed throughout the procedure. The area of the cervicothoracic spine was prepped with Betadine x3 and draped in a sterile manner. Cervical epidural injection  The C7 Tl interspace was identified and marked under AP fluoroscopy. The skin and the subcutaneous tissues in the area were anesthetized with 1   lidocaine. A 17 gauge Tuohy epidural needle was directed toward the interspace using paramedian approach under fluoroscopic guidance until the ligamentum flavum was engaged near the midline of the vertebra. From this point, a hanging drop technique with saline was used to identify 0042 Chart  Andrea Quintanilla  67374 entrance of the needle into the epidural space. Once the drop of saline was drawn into the needle, negative aspiration was confirmed, and contrast solution was injected. Epidurogram  The following finding was obtained  Clear epidurogram was noted up to the level of C3. A continuous catheter was inserted into the epidural space using fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter was directed to the right C3 C4 level. Cervical myelogram  Contrast solution was injected into the catheter and the following finding was obtained  Clear myelograms could be seen on the right at C3 and C4. Then, after negative aspiration, a solution consisting of 2 mL triamcinolone  40 mg/mL , and 4 mL preservative free saline was easily injected. The needle and catheter were removed with a 1  lidocaine flush. The patient s neck was cleaned and a bandage was placed over the needle insertion site. DISPOSITION The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no apparent complications. Vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES  1. Cervical radiculopathy. 2. Cervical degenerative disc disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES  1. Cervical radiculopathy. 2. Cervical degenerative disc disease. OPERATION TITLES  1. Cervical translaminar epidural injection with intermittent catheter to right C3 C4 level. 2. Right C3 C4 myelogram. 3. Epidurogram. 4. Fluoroscopy supervision of the cervical spine. ANESTHESIA  Local. INDICATIONS This patient suffers from moderate to severe pain due to cervical spine disease. The patient s history and physical exam were reviewed. The risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure were discussed, and all questions were answered to the patient s satisfaction. The patient agreed to proceed, and written informed consent was obtained. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL The patient was brought into the procedure room and placed in the prone position on the fluoroscopy table. Standard monitors were placed, and vital signs were observed throughout the procedure. The area of the cervicothoracic spine was prepped with Betadine x3 and draped in a sterile manner. Cervical epidural injection  The C7 Tl interspace was identified and marked under AP fluoroscopy. The skin and the subcutaneous tissues in the area were anesthetized with 1   lidocaine. A 17 gauge Tuohy epidural needle was directed toward the interspace using paramedian approach under fluoroscopic guidance until the ligamentum flavum was engaged near the midline of the vertebra. From this point, a hanging drop technique with saline was used to identify 0042 Chart  Andrea Quintanilla  67374 entrance of the needle into the epidural space. Once the drop of saline was drawn into the needle, negative aspiration was confirmed, and contrast solution was injected. Epidurogram  The following finding was obtained  Clear epidurogram was noted up to the level of C3. A continuous catheter was inserted into the epidural space using fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter was directed to the right C3 C4 level. Cervical myelogram  Contrast solution was injected into the catheter and the following finding was obtained  Clear myelograms could be seen on the right at C3 and C4. Then, after negative aspiration, a solution consisting of 2 mL triamcinolone  40 mg/mL , and 4 mL preservative free saline was easily injected. The needle and catheter were removed with a 1  lidocaine flush. The patient s neck was cleaned and a bandage was placed over the needle insertion site. DISPOSITION The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no apparent complications. Vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure.

She has a history of cervical disc herniation, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and lumbosacral disc herniation. She had previously tried unsuccessful medications and treatment, including physical therapy, chiropractic management, and various medications.
